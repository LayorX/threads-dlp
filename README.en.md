# threads-dlp

[‰∏≠ÊñáË™™Êòé](./README.md)

---

A command-line tool for downloading videos from Threads.net.

It doesn't rely on the official API or brittle HTML parsing. Instead, it uses **cookie-based authentication** to log in and **intelligently intercepts network traffic** to accurately capture videos. Finally, it calls the powerful **`yt-dlp`** engine to handle the download. This approach ensures stable and efficient operation in a dynamic, login-required web environment.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Cookie Authentication**: No need to enter your username and password. Uses your browser's session cookie for secure login, protecting your account privacy.
- **Intelligent Network Sniffing**: Unlike traditional HTML scrapers, this tool directly analyzes network traffic to accurately capture video resources, resulting in a higher success rate.
- **Highly Configurable**: Freely specify the target user, the number of page scrolls (scraping depth), and the video storage location.
- **Stable and Reliable**: Built upon two mature open-source projects: `Selenium-Wire` and `yt-dlp`.
- **Standardized Environment**: Uses `uv` for package management to ensure a consistent execution environment on any machine.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

**Prerequisites:**
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) installed

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Project**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LayorX/threads-dlp.git
    cd threads-dlp
    ```

2.  **Install `uv` (if not already installed)**
    `uv` is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver.
    ```bash
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

3.  **Create Virtual Environment and Sync Dependencies**
    This command will automatically create a `.venv` virtual environment and install all the necessary packages defined in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This tool requires your Threads session cookie to log in. This method is secure and your password will not be exposed.

### 1. How to Get Your Cookie

1.  In your **Chrome** browser, log in to your Threads account as usual.
2.  After logging in, stay on any Threads page and press the `F12` key to open the "Developer Tools".
3.  In the Developer Tools panel, find and click on the `Application` tab.
4.  In the left-hand menu, under `Storage` -> `Cookies`, click on `https://www.threads.net`.
5.  A list will appear on the right. Find the item where the `Name` is **`sessionid`**.
6.  Click on the `sessionid` row, and a long string of text will be displayed in the `Cookie Value` field below. **Completely copy** this entire string.

### 2. Create the `.env` File

1.  In the project's root directory (`threads-dlp`), manually create a new text file.
2.  Rename the file to `.env` (note the dot at the beginning).
3.  Open the `.env` file with a text editor and write only the following line, replacing `your_cookie_value` with the long string you just copied:
    ```
    THREADS_SESSION_COOKIE="your_cookie_value"
    ```
4.  Save and close the file. Your configuration is complete!

## üí° Usage

All commands are run from the project root directory via `uv run`.

**Basic Usage:**

Scrape the `@zuck` profile with the default 3 scrolls and download to the `downloads` folder.
```bash
uv run python main.py zuck
```

**Advanced Usage:**

Scrape the `@threads` profile with 10 scrolls and download to the `D:\MyVideos` folder.
```bash
uv run python main.py threads --scroll 10 --output D:\MyVideos
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `target`: (Required) The Threads username to process (e.g., `zuck`).
- `--scroll`: (Optional) The number of times to scroll down the page. More scrolls load more posts. Defaults to `3`.
- `--output`: (Optional) The directory path to save the downloaded videos. Defaults to `downloads`.
