# threads-dlp

threads-dlp is a powerful and resilient command-line tool for downloading videos from Threads.net. Born out of necessity, it provides a
reliable solution where other methods fall short.

In an ecosystem where the official Threads API is not readily available to all developers and generic downloaders fail to parse Threads'
modern, dynamic front-end, threads-dlp carves its own path. It does not rely on brittle HTML parsing. Instead, it automates a real browser
to simulate human interaction, ensuring it sees the website exactly as a logged-in user does.

Core Features & Philosophy:

 * Secure Cookie-Based Authentication: To access content behind a login, threads-dlp uses your browser's session cookie. This method is both
   more secure‚Äîas you never expose your password‚Äîand more reliable, effortlessly bypassing complex login forms and two-factor authentication
   (2FA).

 * Intelligent Network Sniffing: The heart of its extraction logic lies in selenium-wire, which intercepts all network traffic from the
   browser. It intelligently filters this traffic and identifies video streams by inspecting their Content-Type headers. This is a far more
   robust technique than searching for specific URL patterns (like .mp4), as it finds the video data regardless of how the URL is formatted.

 * Powered by the Best: For the final download process, the task is delegated to the legendary yt-dlp engine, leveraging its speed,
   reliability, and battle-tested download capabilities.

The name threads-dlp is a direct homage to the venerable yt-dlp project. It embraces the same philosophy of creating a powerful, focused,
and community-needed tool. The 'p' can stand for Python, Plus, or simply serve as a nod to its spiritual successor status in tackling a
new, challenging platform. This project is the result of a deep-dive investigation and a journey through multiple technical challenges,
culminating in a stable and effective tool for creators and archivists.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Secure Cookie Authentication**: No need to enter your username and password. Uses your browser's session cookie for secure login, protecting your account privacy.
- **Intelligent Network Sniffing**: Unlike traditional HTML scrapers, this tool directly analyzes network traffic to accurately capture video resources, resulting in a higher success rate.
- **Highly Configurable**: Freely specify the target user, the number of page scrolls (scraping depth), and the video storage location.
- **Stable and Reliable**: Built upon two mature open-source projects: `Selenium-Wire` and `yt-dlp`.
- **Standardized Environment**: Uses `uv` for package management to ensure a consistent execution environment on any machine.

## üöÄ Installation Guide

**Prerequisites:**
- [Python 3.10+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) installed
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) installed

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Project**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LayorX/threads-dlp.git
    cd threads-dlp
    ```

2.  **Install `uv` (if not already installed)**
    `uv` is an extremely fast Python package installer and resolver.
    ```bash
    # Windows (PowerShell)
    irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex
    # macOS / Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

3.  **Create Virtual Environment and Sync Dependencies**
    This command will automatically create a `.venv` virtual environment and install all the necessary packages defined in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

This tool requires your Threads session cookie to log in. This method is secure and your password will not be exposed.

### 1. How to Get Your Cookie

1.  In your **Chrome** browser, log in to your Threads account as usual.
2.  After logging in, stay on any Threads page and press the `F12` key to open the "Developer Tools".
3.  In the Developer Tools panel, find and click on the `Application` tab.
4.  In the left-hand menu, under `Storage` -> `Cookies`, click on `https://www.threads.net`.
5.  A list will appear on the right. Find the item where the `Name` is **`sessionid`**.
6.  Click on the `sessionid` row, and a long string of text will be displayed in the `Cookie Value` field below. **Completely copy** this entire string.

### 2. Create the `.env` File

1.  In the project's root directory (`threads-dlp`), manually create a new text file.
2.  Rename the file to `.env` (note the dot at the beginning).
3.  Open the `.env` file with a text editor and write only the following line, replacing `your_cookie_value` with the long string you just copied:
    ```
    THREADS_SESSION_COOKIE="your_cookie_value"
    ```
4.  Save and close the file. Your configuration is complete!

## üí° Usage

All commands are run from the project root directory via `uv run`.

**Basic Usage:**

Scrape the `@zuck` profile with the default 3 scrolls and download to the `downloads` folder.
```bash
uv run python main.py zuck
```

**Advanced Usage:**

Scrape the `@threads` profile with 10 scrolls and download to the `D:\MyVideos` folder.
```bash
uv run python main.py threads --scroll 10 --output D:\MyVideos
```

### Command-Line Arguments

- `target`: (Required) The Threads username to process (e.g., `zuck`).
- `--scroll`: (Optional) The number of times to scroll down the page. More scrolls load more posts. Defaults to `3`.
- `--output`: (Optional) The directory path to save the downloaded videos. Defaults to `downloads`.
